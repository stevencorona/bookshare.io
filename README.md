# Bookshare.io

I'm moving to San Francisco and I need to get rid of my (200+) books. I want them to go to good homes.

**So I'm giving away all of my books for free**

This is an free, open-source application. You check out the [Demo](http://bookshare.io), or [read about the project on my blog](http://stevecorona.com/experiment-in-sharinghow-i-launched-bookshareio-in-a-week/).

(Update: All of my books got taken in < 24 hours!)

# Setup
This is a Rails 4 app, running on Heroku. It should be pretty simple to get started with just using the normal `git push heroku` flow.

* I -do- use the full text search features of Postgres, so this will not work w/ MySQL or Sqlite out of the box
* I use Mailgun for sending emails, Cloudinary for handling images, and Stripe for processing payments
* Shipment labels are generated with EasyPost

The application depends on the environmental variablesâ€”

    CLOUDINARY_URL
    STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
    SECRET_TOKEN
    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID
    MAILGUN_API_KEY
    MAILGUN_SMTP_LOGIN
    MAILGUN_SMTP_PASSWORD
    MAILGUN_SMTP_PORT
    MAILGUN_SMTP_SERVER
    SECRET_KEY_BASE
    ADMIN_USERNAME
    ADMIN_PASSWORD

# How to Add books
